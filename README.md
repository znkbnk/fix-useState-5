Mistake 1: Rename the function addToCart to follow the proper naming convention by changing it to addItemToCart.

Mistake 2: Correct the usage of the spread operator in setItems. Update the line to: setItems([...items, product]).

Mistake 3: Add parentheses around the parameter in the map function to fix the mistake. Update the line to: const renderedItems = items.map((item) => { ... }).

Mistake 4: Add a unique key prop to each li element rendered inside the map function to avoid a warning. The key can be set as the index of each item, like key={index}.

Mistake 5: Wrap the text inside each li element with curly braces to display the item correctly. Update the line to: <li>{item}</li>.

Mistake 6: Add a missing closing tag </div> at the end of the return statement.

Mistake 7: Update the first button's onClick event handler to use a function reference instead of invoking the function directly. Update the line to: <button onClick={() => addToCart('Product 1')}>Add to Cart</button>.

Mistake 8: Add a unique key prop to each button rendered. The key can be set as a descriptive string, like key="button1" and key="button2".

Mistake 9: Update the button's text to make it more descriptive. For example, change both buttons' text to: Add Product 1 to Cart and Add Product 2 to Cart.

Mistake 10: Remove the unnecessary export default ShoppingCart; line if this file is not being used as a module.
