This project is focused on practicing
the usage of useState in React, which
is a fundamental hook for managing
state in functional components,
allowing for dynamic and responsive
user interfaces. By identifying and
fixing intentional mistakes in the
provided code, you can enhance
understanding and proficiency in
utilizing useState effectively in
your React projects.

Mistake 1: Rename the function addToCart
to follow the proper naming convention
by changing it to addItemToCart.

Mistake 2: Correct the usage of the 
spread operator in setItems. 

Mistake 3: Add parentheses around the
parameter in the map function to
fix the mistake. 

Mistake 4: Add a unique key prop to
each li element rendered inside the 
map function to avoid a warning.
The key can be set as the index
of each item.

Mistake 5: Wrap the text inside
each li element with curly braces
to display the item correctly. 

Mistake 6: Add a missing closing tag
</div> at the end of the return statement.

Mistake 7: Update the first button's
onClick event handler to use a
function reference instead of invoking
the function directly. 

Mistake 8: Update the button's text
to make it more descriptive.
For example, change both buttons
text to: Add Product 1 to Cart and
Add Product 2 to Cart.

Mistake 9: Add the export
Sdefault ShoppingCart;
